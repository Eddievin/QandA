                <p>Qanda originated from the idea of breaking down the class work notes into questions and answers which aid learners to quickly peruse through a full topic.
                    The platform was created with all learners in mind, who are getting ready for an exam or even those who need to prepare themselves for an interview.
                </p>
                <p>The idea was drafted in 2020 but the platform was completed and launched in July 2021. Since then up tp date, we work very hard to add fresh content to our
                    repository which now has a wealth of resources that can fully equip learners.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our content and resources are freely available and we prefer to keep it that way to encourage our readers acquire as many skills as they would like to.
                    We donâ€™t force our readers to sign up with us or submit their details either.
                     No preconditions and no impediments. Simply Easy Learning!
